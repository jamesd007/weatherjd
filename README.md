The current location's weather is displayed when the App is started
An autocomplete search button is installed

The openweathermap.org API provides a free service but is limited to certain services
To get cities, I used an API to mapbox - api.mapbox.com/geocoding,
I found a writeup by Wendy de Kock (https://javascript.plainenglish.io/create-a-simple-city-autocomplete-field-in-react-f7675d249c74) which described the use of mapbox.
Previously I have written an autocomplete search from scratch in a messenger application. When a user types the '@' symbol in a message, a list of participants on the topic is shown in a drop down list. As the user types the name directly following the '@' symbol, the list is narrowed down. The user may select from the list at any time. It is fairly complex and needs to take into account user actions beside typing - the backspace, movement to centre of field with mouse, pressing delete. At first these were programmed indicidually but then they were handled using a regex pattern for the name and letting React handle keyboard input. Mapbox geolocation and its searh facility work efficiently.
